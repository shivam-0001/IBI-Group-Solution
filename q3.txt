Sharding is a method for distributing data across multiple machines. 
MongoDB uses sharding to support deployments with very large data sets
 and high throughput operations. Database systems with large data sets or high 
 throughput applications can challenge the capacity of a single server. 
 and Handles horizontal scaling across servers using a shard key. This means
  that rather than copying data holistically, sharding copies pieces of the data (or “shards”) across 
  multiple replica sets. These replica sets work together to utilize all of the data.
