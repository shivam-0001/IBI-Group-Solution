This line initializes arr1 as an array by splitting the string "john" into individual characters. 
So, arr1 becomes ["j", "o", "h", "n"].var arr2 = arr1.reverse(); This line assigns arr1 to arr2 
and then reverses the array arr1 in place. The reverse() method modifies the original array and
 also returns the reversed array. Therefore, both arr1 and arr2 will point to the same reversed array, 
 which is ["n", "h", "o", "j"].  var arr3 = "jones".split(''); This line initializes arr3 as an array by
  splitting the string "jones" into individual characters. So, arr3 becomes ["j", "o", "n", "e", "s"].  
  arr2.push(arr3); This line pushes the entire arr3 array as a single element to the end of the arr2 array. 
  After this operation, arr2 will look like ["n", "h", "o", "j", ["j", "o", "n", "e", "s"]]. Note that the last
   element in arr2 is an array itself.  console.log("array 1: length=" + arr1.length + " last=" + arr1.slice(-1));
    This line prints information about arr1. arr1.length will be 4, and arr1.slice(-1) will return the last element of arr1
