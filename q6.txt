Callback hell is a phenomenon that happens when multiple callbacks are nested on top of each other. 
The two common ways of escaping the callback here are by using promises and async/await.
 Promises mainly have three stages such as resolved, rejected, and pending. It makes 
 the code more maintainable and understandable.
